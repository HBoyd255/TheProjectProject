# The Project Project

- Harry Boyd - hboyd255@gmail.com - 06/03/2024

As an engineer, it's only natural that I constantly have 2 or 3 projects on the
go. Until now, these projects have always hade a very loose structure, Typically
being based around a prototype or a proof of concept that I've been working on.

Going forward, I intend to create better structured projects with this document
standing as an outline of the steps required to do so. First by describing the
importance of each step, and then by providing a more specific step by step
guide tailored to the type of project that I typically work on.

I'm going to be giving examples that relate to my
[Battery Server](https://github.com/HBoyd255/BatteryServer) project, as this is
my most recent project.

Side note - (To anybody that may be reading this that may just be starting out
working on hobby projects, This is fine. If you are working on something as a
hobby, your priority, aside from safety of course, should be to have fun. But if
you want to strengthen your skills as a developer, you should consider planning
your projects more thoroughly.)

## Establishing the Project's Foundation.

Choosing the initial location for your project is a critical first step. This
foundational space, while subject to change as project requirements evolve,
serves as the primary hub for development and storage. It's crucial to
differentiate this foundational hub from the project's "homepage"â€”the
public-facing platform where the project is showcased to the world.

It's also essential to distinguish between the home of the project and the home
of the product. The product is the result of the project. For example, when
creating a website, the home of the project could be a git repository, and the
home of the product could be a web server.

The project's foundation, or its "home," may not encompass every component,
particularly in projects that span both software and hardware. However, it
should encapsulate the project's core, providing a centralized point of
coordination and development.

A project can have multiple homes, and it's important to define its primary
home. For example, a project utilizing a git repository could either be based on
the developer's local machine, or on a remote server. Defining this primary home
depends on the project's requirements, for a solo project, the primary home
could be the developer's local machine, but for a project with multiple
contributors, the primary home should be a remote server.

Possible homes for a project include:

- A local directory.
- A remote repository.
- A physical folder.
- A drawer in a desk.
- A Room in a house. (for larger projects)

Wherever the project's home is, it should have a clear place to store notes and
documentation.

## Motivation, purpose and goal.

Before stating development, it's important to have a clear understanding of what
the project is attempting to achieve. This can be broken down into three parts,
the motivation, the purpose and the goal.

The motivation describes why the project exists, what problem the project is
trying to solve, or what concept is the project trying to prove.

The purpose describes what the project is trying to achieve.  
The goal describes what the project will look like when it is finished.

Sometimes the motivation, purpose and goal can be the same thing, but it's
important to detail them both separately to ensure clarity.

For example, in my Battery Server project,  
the motivation is that it can be difficult to keep track of the battery level of
each of my mobile devices.  
The purpose is to overcome the need to constantly check the battery levels of
each of my devices.  
The goal is to be able to monitor these battery levels and to be reminded to
charge the devices when they are low.

## Research

After detailing what you are hoping to get out of the project, take some time to
research the topic. Create a list of existing projects that have similar goals.
Depending on the context, you could either see these as competitors, developers
working towards a common goal, or as a source of inspiration.  
If any of the project already solve the problem that you are trying to solve,
consider contributing to them instead of starting a new project.

However, if you can see any way to improve on the existing projects, or if you
have a new idea that you think could be beneficial, then it's time to start
planning your project.

This list should be logged and saved, for reference throughout the project.

For my battery server project,  
I would research existing battery monitoring systems, and see if there are any
that I could contribute to. If there are none that fit my needs, then I would
start planning my project.
