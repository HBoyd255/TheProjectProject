# Project Planning

- Harry Boyd - hboyd255@gmail.com - 06/03/2024

As an engineer, it's only natural that I constantly have 2 or 3 projects on the
go. Until now, these projects have always hade a very loose structure, Typically
being based around a prototype or a proof of concept that I've been working on.

Going forward, I intend to create better structured projects with this document
standing as an outline of the steps required to do so. First by describing the
importance of each step, and then by providing a more specific step by step
guide tailored to the type of project that I typically work on.

I'm going to be giving examples that relate to my
[Battery Server](https://github.com/HBoyd255/BatteryServer) project, as this is
my most recent project.

Side note - (To anybody that may be reading this that may just be starting out
working on hobby projects, This is fine. If you are working on something as a
hobby, your priority, aside from safety of course, should be to have fun. But if
you want to strengthen your skills as a developer, you should consider planning
your projects more thoroughly.)

## Motivation, purpose and goal.

Before stating to develop a project, it's important to have a clear
understanding of what the project is attempting to achieve. This can be broken
down into three parts, the motivation, the purpose and the goal.

The motivation describes why the project exists, what problem the project is
trying to solve, or what concept is the project trying to prove.

The purpose describes what the project is trying to achieve.  
The goal describes what the project will look like when it is finished.

Sometimes the motivation, purpose and goal can be the same thing, but it's
important to detail them both separately to ensure clarity.

For example, in my Battery Server project,  
the motivation is that it can be difficult to keep track of the battery level of
each of my mobile devices.  
The purpose is to overcome the need to constantly check the battery levels of
each of my devices.  
The goal is to be able to monitor these battery levels and to be reminded to
charge the devices when they are low.

## Research

After detailing what you are hoping to get out of the project, take some time to
research the topic. Create a list of existing projects that have similar goals.
Depending on the context, you could either see these as competitors, developers
working towards a common goal, or as a source of inspiration.  
If any of the project already solve the problem that you are trying to solve,
consider contributing to them instead of starting a new project.

However, if you can see any way to improve on the existing projects, or if you
have a new idea that you think could be beneficial, then it's time to start
planning your project.

This list should be logged and saved, for reference throughout the project.

For my battery server project,  
I would research existing battery monitoring systems, and see if there are any
that I could contribute to. If there are none that fit my needs, then I would
start planning my project.
